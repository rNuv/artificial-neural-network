# Artificial Neural Network

## Description
This is a Python implementation of a very rudimentary 2 layer Neural Network class. The class features a method to feed forward a certain instance for a prediction and another method to train and adjust its weights based on a labelled data instance. I tested the neural network on a linearly inseparable problem like the XOR logic gate. I then tested it on the MNIST database of handwritten digits. With 784 input nodes, 64 hidden nodes and 10 output nodes, the net acheives about 94% accuracy on 10000 test images after being trained with 5 epochs on 60000 training images, which isn't too shabby ðŸ¤· I compared my results with the same neural network implementation in Tensorflow and Tensorflow acheived about an accuracy of about 95-96%.
